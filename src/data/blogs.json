            "content": "Sustainability in software is becoming a core KPI for tech teams in 2025. Green coding involves energy-efficient algorithms, minimalistic design, server optimization, and lightweight frontends. Developers are now using tools like GreenFrame, Ecograder, and Lighthouse to measure their app’s environmental impact. On the backend, switching to carbon-aware cloud providers like Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure's sustainability dashboard is becoming common. Ethical frameworks also recommend limiting data collection, optimizing database queries, and designing for longevity rather than rapid iteration. Adopting these practices not only helps the planet but also enhances performance and user loyalty.",
